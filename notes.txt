News API
========
https://newsapi.org/docs

Authorization
-------------
You can attach your API key to a request in one of three ways:
    Via the apiKey querystring parameter.
    Via the X-Api-Key HTTP header.
    Via the Authorization HTTP header. Bearer optional, do not base 64 encode.
We strongly recommend the either of latter 2 so that your API key isn't visible to others in logs or request sniffing.

Endpoints
---------
https://newsapi.org/

    Top headlines /v2/top-headlines - returns breaking news headlines for a country and category, or currently running on a single or multiple sources. This is perfect for use with news tickers or anywhere you want to display live up-to-date news headlines and images.
        e.g. https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=gb&api_key=APIKey-NewsAPI

    Everything /v2/everything - we index every recent news and blog article published by over 50,000 different sources large and small, and you can search through them with this endpoint. This endpoint is better suited for news analysis and article discovery, but can be used to retrieve articles for display too.
        e.g. https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=tesla&api_key=APIKey-NewsAPI

    We also have a minor endpoint that can be used to retrieve a small subset of the publishers we index from:
    Sources /v2/sources - returns information (including name, description, and category) about the most notable sources we index. This list could be piped directly through to your users when showing them some of the options available.
        e.g. https://newsapi.org/v2/sources?api_key=APIKey-NewsAPI
